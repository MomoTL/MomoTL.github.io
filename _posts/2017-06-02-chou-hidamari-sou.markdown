A mini-episode/promo for Hidamari Sketch X 365 screened at the 2007 "Chou Hidamatsuri in Nippon Budokan" event, where the second season of Hidamari Sketch was announced.
This was translated a long time ago and posted on /a/ when the content was relevant. Hidamari Sketch is one of my favorite slice of life franchises so I urge you to watch it!
